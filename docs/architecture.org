* Introduction
  This document describes the architecture of the entire 
  Visualization project for CBT.

* Architecture for CBT Visualization framework
  
  Below is the architecture diagram for the Visualization
  framework.

  The blue boxes and arrows depict the generation of results
  from the Benchmark tests. As shown in the diagram, results
  are generated after the completion of execution of the
  test scripts. The test scripts in turn requires/uses CBT
  configurations and Ceph configurations. The test scripts
  include a couple of configurations themselves.

* Use-case Scenarios

  There are two main use-case scenarios in which this
  architecture would be used. The architecture may differ
  slightly among the two use-cases in terms of technology as
  well as additional components.

** Use-case scenario 1
   The visualization platform is used to visualize the tests
   run individually by developers on their machine. 

** Use-case scenario 2
   The visualization platform is integrated with teuthology
   and the nightly tests results can be visualized. 

   An added facility to this use-case could be that results
   of the individual tests performed by developers could be
   pulled into this service and displayed along side all the
   other tests.
