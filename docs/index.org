#+TITLE: Design document for CBT Output Visualization
#+Author: M.S.Soumya
#+Date: [2017-10-23 Mon]


* My understanding of the project
  The aim of the project is to develop a simple web based platform
  which enables developers to visualize the results of various
  benchmarking tests. From the documentation of [[https://github.com/ceph/cbt][CBT]], I understand that
  there are multiple types of benchmarking tests ie: librbdfio,
  radosbench, rbdfio, and kvmrbdfio each with a specific purpose. The
  scope of this project was limited to radosbench and librbdfio. The
  design of this platform must be nimble enough to include future
  integration of kvmrbdfio and rbdfio. Keeping cohesion and coupling
  in mind, each test should be independent of the other, but data
  pre-processing steps(if any), should be general enough to be re-used
  across multiple benchmarks. 

** Design Considerations
   To be able to make a more realistic timeline, these are a few
   design considerations I would like to address. (Please consider
   these as my doubts regarding the project). These can also be
   considered as next steps for the project.

   - Which frontend framework do we consider?  
     + I am comfortable using Flask and Angular2 for the web-pages.
   - Is there an existing mechanism to save/log the results of
     benchmarks?
     + If yes, is there a database already in place?
   - Details/Description of the benchmark outputs to be able to display them more
     meaningfully.
   - From the sample fio output provided, there is a clear distinction
     between two types of data.
     + Data that can be plotted based on this particular benchmark output.
     + Data which needs previous outputs to make an inference. 
   - How are the benchmarks run?
   - When are the Benchmarks run?
   - How to integrate the CBT framework and the visualization
     framework?
       
* Preliminary survey on Visualization tools
  There are several open source tools available for visualizing
  data. Now, to best suite our purpose I looked at a few IOPs
  visualization tools. The following table summarizes each library and
  its capabilities.

  Factors for choosing the visualization library:
  - Ease of displaying on a web-page
  - Easy/seamless integration with web framework
  - Allows easy display of time series

* Project Timeline
  Below is a tentative project timeline, aligned with the proposed
  timeline on the website. (As more design considerations become
  clear, the timeline can be enhanced with more specific task
  breakdown.)


- Project Begin date :: December 5th; 
- Project End date   :: March 5th;

** Mid Term goals:
- Figure out the key audience, the dataset and define “what to
  visualize?”.
- Research on various available tools and their compatibility with the
  existing CBT framework.
- Get the design approved by mentors.
- Clear idea of the tools to be used, along with a prototype with
  smaller datasets.

** End Term goals:
- Scaling to larger datasets.
- Integration of data visualization into CBT and Teuthology.
